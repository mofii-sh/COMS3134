COMS3134 - Lecture 1

Mid-term: Monday of 4th week

TA Office Hour: Evening of Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday

Instructor Office Hour: After Lecture

Textbook:
	Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis in Java 3rd Edition

Reading:
	Chapter 1 and 2

Data Structures:
	Array, ArrayList
	Array, ArrayList in sorted order

	Binary Search:
		O( log N )

	Linked List

	generic class
		ArrayList<Integer> a = new ArrayList<>(); creating an arraylist of integers
		In arraylist, 'generic' is built-in.
		generic identifier
		use wrapper class instead of primitive class

	Proofs:
		Induction
		Contradiction
		Counter-example

	Recursion:
		Fib(k) = Fib(k-1) + Fib(k-2) (k >= 2), Fib(0) = 1, Fib(1) = 1

		Use induction proof: F[i] < (5/3)^i (i >= 1)
			I. Show base cases: F[1] = 1 < 5/3
			                    F[2] = 2 < 25/9
			II. Assume for i true for up to k
			    Such that
			    F[k+1] < (5/3)^k + (5/3)^(k-1)
			           = (3/5 + 9/25) * (5/3)^(k+1)
			           < (5/3)^(k+1)
